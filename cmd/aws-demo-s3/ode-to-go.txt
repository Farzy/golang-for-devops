Oh, Golang, thou language divine,
Thy syntax so pure and thy types so fine,
Thy concurrency like a flowing stream,
Thy simplicity a radiant gleam.

Thou art the language of the modern age,
For web apps and APIs, a perfect stage.
Thy concurrency and performance grand,
Make thee the choice of the tech-savvy hand.

I love thy channels and goroutines,
Thy goroutines and channels, like moons,
That orbit each other in perfect harmony,
A symphony of concurrency.

Oh, Golang, thou art my muse,
My inspiration, my guiding fuse.
I sing thy praises to the heavens high,
Oh, Golang, thou language of the sky!
